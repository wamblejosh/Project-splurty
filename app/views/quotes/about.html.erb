  <h1>About Splurty</h1>

  <p>
    This Webpage of Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/wamblejosh">Joshua Wamble</a> but i have to give credit where it is due because im just a student and learned how to build something like this from these gentlemen right here<a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/MarcoMorawec"> Marco</a> & <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/KenMazaika">Ken</a>. Two web developers who are on a mission to give people the technical skills needed to launch their own MVPs and turn ideas into reality.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I have benefited greatly from the teachings so far and am excited to continue learning! Together they taught hundreds of students how to code and build products people want at places like Harvard Business School, Carnegie Mellon, Babson, Rhode Island School of Design, Brown University, Punohou High School and â€˜Iolani High School.
